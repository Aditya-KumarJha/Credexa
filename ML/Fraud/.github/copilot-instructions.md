# Copilot Instructions

- [x] Project folders created: .github, src, models, data, tests, scripts, app.
- [x] Scaffold modules and baseline files.
- [x] Add README, requirements.txt, unit tests, and sample data.
- [x] Implement hybrid fraud detection pipeline as specified.
- [x] Export model artifacts and inference script.
- [x] Provide FastAPI app for deployment.

## Project Completed Successfully! ðŸŽ‰

This hybrid fraud detection pipeline includes:

### Core ML Components
- **Image Model**: ResNet50/EfficientNet CNN with Grad-CAM visualization
- **Text Model**: TF-IDF + XGBoost with OCR (EasyOCR/Tesseract fallback)
- **Metadata Model**: Feature engineering + IsolationForest anomaly detection
- **Ensemble Model**: Logistic Regression stacking meta-classifier

### Training & Evaluation
- **Data Augmentation**: Logo overlays, rotation, compression, brightness/contrast
- **Loss Functions**: Focal loss for class imbalance
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1, ROC AUC, per-forgery analysis
- **Class Weighting**: Automated handling of imbalanced datasets

### Deployment Artifacts
- **Training Pipeline**: `src/train_pipeline.py` - Complete orchestration
- **Inference Script**: `scripts/predict.py` - Standalone predictions with explanations
- **FastAPI App**: `app/main.py` - REST API with web interface
- **Model Export**: Automatic saving of trained artifacts

### Sample Data
- 20 sample certificates (10 authentic + 10 forged) with metadata
- Realistic forgery patterns: metadata manipulation, visual tampering, fake issuers

### API Features
- POST /verify endpoint with multipart upload
- Batch processing support
- Grad-CAM heatmap generation
- Comprehensive result explanations
- Health checks and model info endpoints

Ready for training, inference, and deployment!
